I have created Login and registration feature, Fake Backend is used for user registration. Registered users login details get stored in localstorage.
When User login into the system he will be redirected to Dashborad.
In Dashboard i have provided 3 button Record, Stop and download. Record will record the video via webcam. Stop button will stops recording. Download will download the recorded video.
I haven't created functionality to upload on server and show list of recorded videos.

1) Download the code the from git repository.
2) npm install -g @angular/cli if angular is not installed
3) Run npm install to install all the dependencies
4) Install npm install redcordrtc for running webcam feature, if not installed via npm install
5) npm start to run the project. You can access project by http://localhost:8080/
